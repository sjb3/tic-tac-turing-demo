// React Router (not included) may easily use hash-based URLs like https://example.com/index.html#/users/me/edit. This is nice & easy when getting started with local development, but for a public app you probably want real URLs like https://example.com/users/me/edit.
// Create a static.json file to configure the web server for clean browserHistory with React Router v3 & BrowserRouter with v4:


{
  "root": "build/",
  "routes": {
    "/**": "index.html"
  }
}
